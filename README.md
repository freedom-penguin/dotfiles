# My Dotfiles

## Important Notes 
- I use NeoVim BTW 
- The config has no hardcoded systemd setting to it 

### Instructions - RTFM 
* `stow app_name/`  
* `stow */` stow everything
* `$ ./StartGUI` to boot up my hyprland conf 
* `$ startx` to boot up my i3-gaps conf

### Screen Sharing (Hyprland)
* `yay -S xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland-git`
* Configured in ./hypr/.config/hypr/execs.conf

### Audio
* my Hyprland config uses pipewire and wireplumber
* (so is my xinit)

### Wallpapers 
* Must be located in ``~/Pictures/Wallpapers``


### Competition
* This configuration is my own personal preference and it does not try to compete with others
